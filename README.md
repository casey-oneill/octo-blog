## Features
- **Simple**: Deploy once, blog forever.
- **Complete**: Comes with functionality expected of a standard personal blog. Organize your posts into categories. Tell the world about yourself with the _About_ section.
- **Responsive**: Your blog will look good on all devices, no matter the screen size.
- **Customizable**: Easily customize your blog's look with [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) themes or dig in and modify the project's React components to your taste.
- **Extendable**: Something missing? Modify this free and open-source [React](https://reactjs.org/) project to implement the features you need.

## How it Works
The OctoBlog template fetches blog posts from your repository using the GitHub API. This means that you will only need to deploy your blog website once - then you're set to blog for life!

You write your blog posts in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), commit them to your blog's GitHub repository, and watch as they are added to your blog website.

## Technical Details
OctoBlog is implemented using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and [octokit.js](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js). It's also free and open-source, making it a great jumping-off point for developers looking for a free, customizable blog template.
